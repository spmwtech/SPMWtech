From a young age, I've been passionate about law, justice, fairness and helping the underprivilled in our society. Now, as I prepare to pursue a Bachelors degree in Social Work, I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. However, the costs associated with university fees and living expenses can be daunting. Your contribution, no matter the size, will make a significant difference in helping me overcome these financial barriers.
