## Statement of cash flows

The general template of a cash flow statement is as follows: Cash Inflow - Cash Outflow + Opening Balance = Closing Balance

| Cash Inflow | Outflow   | Opening Balance |
| ----------- | --------- | --------------- |
| _Monday_    | `Tuesday` | **Wednesday**   |
| 1           | 2         | 3               |

**Example 1:** in the beginning of September, Ellen started out with $5 in her bank account. 

- Cash inflow: $20
- Closing balance: $20 â€“ $7 + $5 = $18

> **Important:** the cash flow statement only considers the exchange of actual cash, and ignores what the person in question owes or is owed.

## Statement of financial position (balance sheet)

The balance sheet is the financial statement showing a firm's assets, liabilities and equity (capital)

- **fixed assets**
  - property
  - equipment (such as factory machinery)
- **intangible assets**
  - copyrights
    - pending
    - international
- goodwill

Owner's equity, sometimes referred to as net assets, is represented differently depending on the type of business ownership.
